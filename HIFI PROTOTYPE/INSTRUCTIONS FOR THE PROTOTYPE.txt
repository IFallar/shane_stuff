HELLO!

This semi functional Mock-Up prototype was made by Shane Fallar; 

This is intended to serve as the HiFi Prototype of Group A. 

As of now, this mock up provides a basic and rudimentary rundwon of 
what the project will look like in the future.

	Working Features:
	
		- This prototype comes with a sample article; press the read more on the
		  "Gallic Wars" to see it. (October 3)
		
		- The interactive map also has some basic functionality, click some of its
		  parts to preview the placeholder pop-up. (October 3)
		
		- Hover effects and styling has been added. (October 3)

		-Sign and Sign in window now availabe (October 4)

I must reitirate that this is only the first version, a proto-prototype, and thus some things will 
be subject to change, but overall, the look of the website in the future should remain consistent with 
what you see here.
